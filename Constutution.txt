4. Internal Governance


5. Principles

  5.1) Motherland: The nation must be protected from the influence of outisde forces; national independence, both economically and politically, must be achieved to further develop the nation and prevent catastrophe. We must preserve cultural and national identities in our nation by everting to a more traditional society, free of social degeneracy and the marketing of it.
  
  5.2) Socialism: Capitalism has made multiculturalism impossible due to the fact that it exploits all antagonisms (class and culture) in order to generate fear, then sell a solution. A nation cannot be united if it does not provide for its people. Capitalism has allowed our nation to be sold to outside forces and is weakening the nation in every respect.
  
  5.3) Revolution: The political system as we know it is corrupt through and through, and cannot be reformed through the traditional democratic process put forth by the government that currently presides. The people must work together through a grassroots methodology to gain independence from the state and corporations in both a monetary and resource based manner.
