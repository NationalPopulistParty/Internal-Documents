1) The National Question 

The first and foremost issue that a nationalist movement must address is the National Question and our stance concerning national minorities. So what constitutes a Nation? 

It is our view that a nation is an organic gathering of Peoples that share a common history, territory, language, culture, and economic life. A question that may arise in the reader is why did we dismiss ethnicity as a qualifier for a nation? 
We dismiss ethnicity as the modern French, Italian, and even German nations are made up of different ethnic groups and as no sane person denies the existence of the French, Italian, or German Nations on the grounds that there have existed and continue to exist regional variations in culture and tongue within these groups. We therefore cannot define a nation based on ethnicity but instead we should consider ethnic unity as being a non-sequitur in a nation as a whole. Indeed, the Ottoman and Roman Empires serve as prime examples of a single Nation comprising multiple ethnic or racial groups united by tongue, culture, values, and Interest. Today the United States itself provides a similar example, as the descendents of Chinese, German, Irish, and other immigrants embrace the American Nation and American values and culture to become a part of the Nation itself. Thus it becomes clear that race and ethnicity are non-factors in the National Question and that the primary factors that must be held in common and preserved for the continuance of the Nation include
  - Language
  - Culture and Social Values
  - A shared sense of belonging and purpose
 
It is a natural consequence of this view that we denounce all forms of ethnonationalism and racism the approach to nationalism that this party is undertaking is one of that promotes the unity of all people regardless of ethncity under the banner of national solidarity. 
What then is the form that we purpose? We purpose a form of integral nationalism we hold that the national body is an integral whole and must be maintained and perserved just as a human body faces ssues without one of their limbs just as the national body can not be seperated or detactched. We at the National Populist Party fight for national unity as well as the preservation of the national, regional. and local cultures that make up the national body.
