1) The National Question 


The first and foremost issue that a nationalist movement must address is the national question and our stance concerning national minorities. So what constitutes a nation? 

A nation is an organic gathering of peoplehood that share a common history, territory, language, culture, and economic life. A question that may arise in the reader is why did we dismiss ethnicity as a qualifier for a nation? 
We dismiss ethnicity as the modern French, Italian, and even German nations are made up of different ethnic groups and as no sane person dismisses these three nations as being a nation we also can not define a nation based on ethnicity but instead we should consider ethnic unity as being a non-sequitur in a nation as a whole.
