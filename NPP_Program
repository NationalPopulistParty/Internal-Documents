1) The National Question 

The first and foremost issue that a nationalist movement must address is the National Question and our stance concerning national minorities. So what constitutes a Nation? 

It is our view that a nation is an organic gathering of Peoples that share a common history, territory, language, culture, and economic life. A question that may arise in the reader is why did we dismiss ethnicity as a qualifier for a nation? 
We dismiss ethnicity as the modern French, Italian, and even German nations are made up of different ethnic groups and as no sane person denies the existence of the French, Italian, or German Nations on the grounds that there have existed and continue to exist regional variations in culture and tongue within these groups. We also can not define a nation based on ethnicity but instead we should consider ethnic unity as being a non-sequitur in a nation as a whole. Indeed, the Ottomon or Roman Empires serve as prime examples of a single Nation comprising multiple ethnic or racial groups united by tongue, culture, values, and Interest. Today the United States itself provides a similar example, as the descendents of Chinese, German, Irish, and other immigrants embace the American Nation and American values and culture to become a part of the Nation itself. Thus it becomes clear that race and ethnicity are non-factors in the National Question and that the primary factors that must be held in common and preservedfor the continuance of the Nation include
  - Language
  - Culture and Social Values
  - A shared sense of beloning and purpose
 
It is a natural consequence of this view that we denounce all forms of ethnonationalism and racism.
